              <p class="biography">Hi, I'm Sahaj Patel, a current sophmore in AMST at Bergen County Academies. From a very early age, I have been playing cricket and loved the sport. However, the fear of getting hit by blazing 90 mph leather ball is terrifying! In fact, there is a major concussion per 9000 balls, there is ~300 balls per game. With this being said, I understand and want to prevent the fear of long term damage playing the game that you love. For this reason, I have dedicted my time to improve awarness for the concern and improvement of safety in all sports. One day, I hope CTE and all sports related injuries became a thing of the past, and we can enjoy what we love without the need to compromise for injury. </p>

Realizing the despair that CTE can bring on an athlete, and how it can end their entire career, I am dedicated to educating the world about this issue so everybody can stay safe. As a violinist attending the Juilliard School in the Preparatory Division, I know how even the smallest things can change how one approaches what one loves. I want to make sure everyone can keep following their passions. Additionally, I am actively involved in cell biology/medicinal research, playing volleyball, and spending time with friends and family.</p>

              <p class="biography">Hi, I’m Alvin, a sophomore in AMST at Bergen County Academies. I started playing baseball at age 6 and quickly developed a passion for pitching. I became the ace of my town travel team, winning multiple seasons and a district championship. However, in 6th grade, I was diagnosed with capitellum OCD and underwent minimally invasive surgery on my right elbow. This experience taught me the hard truth that an injury can truly destroy one’s life. CTE is no different. Once one gets CTE, their life will be ruined. This is why I am dedicated to spreading awareness of this horrific disease. Today, I still play baseball at a high level and compete in 17u and 18u tournaments.</p>
