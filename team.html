              <p class="biography">Hi, I'm Sahaj Patel, a current sophmore in AMST at Bergen County Academies. From a very early age, I have been playing cricket and loved the sport. However, the fear of getting hit by blazing 90 mph leather ball is terrifying! In fact, there is a major concussion per 9000 balls, there is ~300 balls per game. With this being said, I understand and want to prevent the fear of long term damage playing the game that you love. For this reason, I have dedicted my time to improve awarness for the concern and improvement of safety in all sports. One day, I hope CTE and all sports related injuries became a thing of the past, and we can enjoy what we love without the need to compromise for injury. </p>

Realizing the despair that CTE can bring on an athlete, and how it can end their entire career, I am dedicated to educating the world about this issue so everybody can stay safe. As a violinist attending the Juilliard School in the Preparatory Division, I know how even the smallest things can change how one approaches what one loves. I want to make sure everyone can keep following their passions. Additionally, I am actively involved in cell biology/medicinal research, playing volleyball, and spending time with friends and family.</p>

              <p class="biography">Hi, I’m Alvin, a sophomore in AMST at Bergen County Academies. I started playing baseball at age 6 and quickly developed a passion for pitching. I became the ace of my town travel team, winning multiple seasons and a district championship. However, in 6th grade, I was diagnosed with capitellum OCD and underwent minimally invasive surgery on my right elbow. This experience taught me the hard truth that an injury can truly destroy one’s life. CTE is no different. Once one gets CTE, their life will be ruined. This is why I am dedicated to spreading awareness of this horrific disease. Today, I still play baseball at a high level and compete in 17u and 18u tournaments.</p>

                <p class="biography">Hello, I’m Hridank Shukla, and I am also a sophomore at Bergen County Academies in AMST. In middle school, I grew an interest in medicine - specifically cancer research - and in high school, pursued this passion through independent research and volunteering. Over the past few months, my growing interest in neuroscience led me to CTE, which I quickly realized was a developing issue in countless sports. After forming a group and working on this initiative, I am happy to be collaborating in our BCA Health Education team and plan to continue this initiative to the national-level. Outside of academics, I enjoy playing table tennis and participating in Boy Scouts.</p>

Training from five years old, I have been an enthusiastic athlete competing at the highest level of youth league: Major League Soccer (MLS) NEXT. Unfortunately, however, due to my extensive participation in soccer, I have experienced and witnessed teammates acquire numerous injuries. This is why I am helping spread awareness of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE): to help players avoid lethal brain injuries and to advocate for safety procedures to keep our nation’s best athletes healthy.</p>

              <p class="biography">Hello, I’m Edward, a sophomore in AMST at Bergen County Academies. Over the past year, I’ve conducted Machine Learning research in creating more accessible diagnostic tools for neurological disorders. Throughout middle and high school I also participated in Public Forum debate which trained me to compress complex ideas into bite-sized pieces that anyone can understand. Most of my key interests lie in the intersection of these two areas, developing Scientific knowledge and communicating it effectively to truly democratize the benefits of modern technology. The destructive yet esoteric nature of CTE makes it all-the-more important to spread awareness, and this goal is what motivates me as a member of the BCA Health Education team. Outside of health education, I am a chorister in the BCA Chamber Choir and the NJMEA All-State choir, I participate in Olympiads such as USACO and USABO, and I am a chess instructor.</p>
