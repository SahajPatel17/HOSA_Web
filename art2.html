            <h1 class="subheader">CTE</h1>
            One disorder that has come under intense
            spotlight due to its link with recurrent head
            impacts and concussions is Chronic Traumatic
            Encephalopathy (CTE). This disease entails
            the slow buildup of anomalous proteins in the
            brain that brings about mass killing of brain
            cells and degeneration of brain tissue over an
            extensive period. In distinction from acute
            traumatic brain injuries, whose symptoms are
            prompt and particular, CTE may manifest
            long after many years have gone by post the
            primary trauma.

            <h1 class="subheader">Effects</h1>
            A cognitive condition in CTE that is a
            negative consequence to this dynamic injury.
            They have impairments with memory, loss of
            judgement and confusion— as well as
            difficulty concentrating. It has been linked
            with an array of changes including behavior
            plus mood which are usually difficult to deal
            with by both the individual affected and
            those surrounding him or her. Symptoms
            commonly include irritability and aggression,
            impulsivity, depression, as well as anxiety.
            When it progresses to more advanced phases,
            CTE can trigger motor impairments that
            mimic those seen in other neurodegenerative
            conditions like Parkinson's— which involves
            tremors and an inability to effectively
            coordinate one's movements together with
            complications walking or standing upright.
            Moreover, research has implied a substantial
            link between CTE and heightened tendencies
            towards harboring suicidal thoughts or
            engaging in such behaviors.
            CTE detection continues being notably
            elusive. Only upon death can CTE be
            conclusively identified posthumously by means
            of studying brain tissues
            <br>
            <br>
            <h1 class="subheader">Prevention</h1>
            It is crucial that athletes, coaches, parents and healthcare
            professionals are aware of the risks related to recurrent head
            injuries. Recognition of the signs and symptoms of concussions
            and other traumatic brain injuries is key to early intervention—
            decreasing chances for re-injury later.
            In addition, the adoption of changes in rules and safety
            precautions in contact sports can contribute to reducing the
            frequency of head traumas. This involves no leniency on those
            engaging in dangerous play through strict penalties; fairness
            and safety of competition should be promoted, including
            emphasizing the correct technique during training as well as
            actual gameplay.
            The use of helmets and mouthguards can be taken as a
            preventive measure to ensure that injuries don't happen, such as
            head injuries. The protective equipment must fit well and needs
            to be checked often for any damage since they should comply
            with the safety standards set by authorized organizations.
            These measures are only some of the many ways CTE can be
            prevented. It is encouraged that readers research the different
            ways this degenerative brain disease can be stopped.
